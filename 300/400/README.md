# 400 - Configure the Server on Hetzner

 After having created a server (here: ```agility-game-1```), connect to it with SSH as shown below, using its public IP address (here: ```116.203.36.60```) as **root**. Don't forget to append the command with ``` -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_hetzner``` which is required when using a non-default name for your key pair.
